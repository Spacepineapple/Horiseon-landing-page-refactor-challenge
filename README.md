# Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

This landing page was created as my solution to the first challenge task of a
web development bootcamp. All assets including the index.html and the style.css
files were provided. However, the HTML file was comprised almost entirely of
divs, the CSS file was not well consolidated with a great deal of unnecessary
repetition and there were a small number of elements which did not have the
desired functionality.

My task was to take this file and perform the following tasks:
1. Update the index.html file to use semantic HTML elements and follow
   accessibility best practice
2. Consolidate and organise the elements in the CSS file
3. Ensure all elements had the expected functionality
4. Tidy all files and add comments as appropriate

## Table of Contents

## Installation

All of the required files are included in this repository and no installation
should be required. The index.html file should render in any modern browser on
both a desktop or mobile device. However, please note that due to the use of the
bject-fit and object-fit CSS properties, this page is unlikely to render
correctly in Internet Explorer and for this reason I advise that an alternative
browser is used to view this page. Please also note that this page does not use
responsive design elements and while the page should still render, it may not
have the desired appearance and layout on smaller screen sizes.
