A live version of this page has been deployed at
https://spacepineapple.github.io/Horiseon-landing-page-refactor-challenge/ .

## Description <a id="description"></a>

This landing page was created as my solution to the first challenge task of a
web development bootcamp. All assets including the index.html and the style.css
files were provided. However, the HTML file was comprised almost entirely of
divs, the CSS file was not well consolidated with a great deal of unnecessary
repetition and there were a small number of elements which did not have the
desired functionality.

My task was to take this file and perform the following tasks:
1. Update the index.html file to use semantic HTML elements and follow
   accessibility best practice
2. Consolidate and organise the elements in the CSS file
3. Ensure all elements had the expected functionality
4. Tidy all files and add comments as appropriate

The appearance of the page is as follows:

aside](./images/lower-screenshot.png)

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

All of the required files are included in this repository and no installation
should be required. The index.html file should render in any modern browser on
both a desktop or mobile device. 

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

To use the files within this repository, first download the repository and then
open the index.html file in any browser. 

Please note that due to the use of the object-fit and object-fit CSS properties,
this page is unlikely to render correctly in Internet Explorer and for this
reason I advise that an alternative browser is used to view this page. Please
also note that this page does not use responsive design elements and while the
page should still render, it may not have the desired appearance and layout on
smaller screen sizes.

## Credits <a id="credits"></a>

This project was completed by myself -- Neal Reeves -- using image assets and
starter code from the edX Front-End Web Development bootcamp. My contribution
was to fix any broken functionality, consolidate and simplify the CSS file, add
semantic elements to the HTML source code and add comments where
appropriate.
